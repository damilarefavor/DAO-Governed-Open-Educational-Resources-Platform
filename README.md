# 📚 DAO-Governed Open Educational Resources Platform

Welcome to a decentralized platform for open educational resources (OER) built on the Stacks blockchain! This Web3 project empowers creators to share educational content, earn royalties, and participate in a DAO that governs the platform, ensuring quality and fairness.

## ✨ Features

- 📖 **Content Submission**: Creators can upload educational resources (metadata, hashes) to the blockchain.
- 💰 **Royalty System**: Contributors earn STX royalties based on content usage (e.g., views or downloads).
- 🗳 **DAO Governance**: A DAO manages content curation, approves submissions, and sets royalty rates.
- 🔍 **Content Verification**: Ensures content originality and prevents duplicates using unique hashes.
- 🌍 **Global Access**: Users access high-quality, immutable educational resources for free.
- 🛡 **Transparency**: All transactions, governance decisions, and royalty distributions are on-chain.
- 🔄 **Version Control**: Track updates to educational resources with immutable versioning.
- ✅ **Quality Assurance**: DAO members vote on content quality to maintain high standards.

## 🛠 How It Works

### For Contributors
1. Generate a SHA-256 hash of your educational content (e.g., PDF, video, quiz).
2. Submit the content metadata (title, description, hash, category) via the `content-submission` contract.
3. The DAO reviews and approves the submission based on quality and originality.
4. Once approved, your content is registered, and you earn royalties based on usage.

### For Users
1. Browse the content catalog using the `content-discovery` contract.
2. Access resources for free, with usage tracked on-chain to calculate royalties.
3. Verify content authenticity using the `content-verification` contract.

### For DAO Members
1. Stake STX to join the DAO via the `dao-membership` contract.
2. Vote on content approvals, royalty rates, and platform upgrades using the `dao-governance` contract.
3. Earn governance rewards for participation.
